## DYNAMIC SOLUTION INNOVATORS
**Software Engineer** | *April 2023 – Present* | Dhaka, Bangladesh

As a core member of the engineering team, I design and build mission-critical enterprise systems for major government and public sector clients. My role encompasses the full software development lifecycle, with a strong focus on backend architecture, security, and operational excellence.

*   Engineered secure and scalable enterprise Java EE applications for critical government infrastructures, translating complex offline bureaucratic processes into streamlined digital workflows.
*   Acted as a key member of the internal cybersecurity team, conducting threat modeling sessions and providing guidance on secure coding practices for projects across the organization.

### Key Projects

### **E-Appeal: Digital Appeals System for NBR & USAID**
*A digital platform for managing tax-related appeals.*

*   **Pioneered the company’s first enterprise-scale JSF application**, establishing engineering guidelines and architectural best practices that became the standard for subsequent projects.
*   Designed and implemented a multi-layer architecture (View, Service, Repository) with a strict separation of concerns.
*   **Implemented a centralized RBAC security model** using Jakarta Security with a custom form-based authentication mechanism.
*   Integrated Java Message Service (JMS) for **asynchronous, decoupled event handling** (email/SMS notifications), improving system resilience.

### **Project Scratch: Internal Core Services Platform**
*An internal platform designed to accelerate development by providing reusable core services.*

*   **Engineered a centralized observability stack** using Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana. Exposed JMX metrics from GlassFish to a Prometheus endpoint for real-time application and infrastructure monitoring.
*   **Dockerized the complete application stack**, including GlassFish, PostgreSQL, MinIO, and RabbitMQ, to create a portable development environment.
*   **Developed a reusable Lazy Data Model component** for PrimeFaces and successfully **contributed a related feature enhancement to the official PrimeFaces open-source library** (<a href="https://github.com/primefaces/primefaces/pull/12865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR #12865</a>).




### **SHMS: Smart Hotel Management System**
*A nationwide licensing and registration system for hotels and restaurants.*

*   Contributed to the design and implementation of a generic, **state-driven approval workflow** engine, making the logic reusable across multiple application types and minimizing code duplication.
*   Utilized Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) principles to cleanly separate cross-cutting concerns like notifications and auditing from core business logic.


### **BCIC-ERP: End-to-End Enterprise Resource Planning**
*A comprehensive ERP system for process automation across 12 integrated modules.*

*   **Assumed full ownership of the Procurement module**, leading its entire lifecycle from business analysis (As-Is/To-Be modeling) and database schema design to hands-on development and successful client delivery.
