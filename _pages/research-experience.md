### **Code Generation in Bangla: Low-Resource Language Adaptation**
<small>2025 | Shared Task at the BLP Workshop, co-located with IJCNLP-AACL</small>

*   **Low-Resource Adaptation:** Investigated code generation in Bangla by fine-tuning open-source models (Llama 3, TigerLLM, Qwen) using parameter-efficient **LoRA** adapters to overcome data scarcity challenges.
*   **Reasoning Enhancement:** Enhanced model reasoning via **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting and a self-refinement loop that iteratively critiques and corrects generated code based on execution feedback.
*   **Error Analysis:** Conducted rigorous error analysis to identify failure modes in code generation tasks, achieving **85% accuracy** and securing **4th place out of 32 teams**.
*   **Publication:** <a href="">AdversaryAI at BLP-2025 Task 2: A Think, Refine, and Generate (TriGen) System with LoRA and Self-Refinement for Code Generation</a>

### **BRAINTEASER: Advanced Commonsense Reasoning in Language Models**
<small>2024 | Shared Task at SemEval 2024, co-located with NAACL</small>

*   Designed **data augmentation pipelines** to improve model robustness for complex commonsense reasoning tasks involving lateral thinking puzzles.
*   Conducted a **comparative analysis of advanced language models**, analyzing performance gaps and reasoning patterns in non-standard logical scenarios.

### **Violence Inciting Text Detection (VITD) in Bangla**
<small>2023 | Shared Task at the BLP Workshop, co-located with EMNLP</small>

*   Applied **semi-supervised self-training techniques** to address class imbalance and small dataset limitations, significantly improving model performance on minority classes.
*   Enhanced dataset diversity and quality through **back-translation** using the Googletrans API, which improved semantic variety while correcting linguistic inconsistencies in Bangla text.
*   Implemented an **ensemble approach** combining multiple transformer models with bagging and majority voting to reduce prediction variance and increase overall robustness, achieving **Top 20 rank**.

### **Improving Answer Space Diversity in Visual Question Answering (VQA)**
<small>2022 | Undergraduate Thesis Project</small>

*   Conducted a comparative study of various state-of-the-art VQA methods, identifying and analyzing their core limitations, particularly in answer distribution.
*   Addressed the **"Answer Space Diversity" limitation** in the VQA v2 dataset by augmenting training data with automatically generated, contextually relevant question-answer pairs using template-based synthesis.
*   Demonstrated improved model performance on long-tail and less frequent answer categories, reducing the model's bias toward frequent answers.
