### **Violence Inciting Text Detection (VITD) in Bangla**
<small>2023 | Shared Task at the BLP Workshop, co-located with EMNLP</small>

*   Applied semi-supervised self-training techniques to address class imbalance and small dataset limitations, significantly improving model performance.
*   Enhanced dataset diversity and quality through back-translation using the Googletrans API, which improved semantic variety while correcting linguistic inconsistencies.
*   Implemented an ensemble approach combining multiple models with bagging and majority voting to reduce prediction variance and increase overall robustness.

### **BRAINTEASER: A Novel Task Defying Common Sense**
<small>2024 | Shared Task at SemEval 2024, co-located with NAACL</small>

*   Designed data augmentation pipelines to improve model robustness for complex commonsense reasoning tasks.
*   Conducted a comparative analysis of advanced language models.

### **Improving Answer Space Diversity in Visual Question Answering (VQA)**
<small>2022 | Undergraduate Thesis Project</small>

*   Conducted a comparative study of various state-of-the-art VQA methods, identifying and analyzing their core limitations, particularly in answer distribution.
*   Addressed the "Answer Space Diversity" limitation in the VQA v2 dataset by augmenting training data with automatically generated, contextually relevant question-answer pairs.
*   Demonstrated improved model performance on long-tail and less frequent answer categories.
